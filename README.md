# PIDR-2025-MetaQuest
This is the main page for the PIDR Project for the second year students at Télécom Nancy. The PIDR is a project that aims to give the students an overview of research.

The theme we chose to work on is interfacing an *IMU* (Inertial Measurement Unit) with the virtual reality headset *MetaQuest 3*.

# Architecture
The project is architectured into three repositories :
- **PIDR-2025-MetaQuest-ESP32** : contains the Arduino source code for the code that runs on the ESP32
- **PIDR-2025-MetaQuest-Unity** : contains the C# source code for the Unity application that will eventually run on the VR headset
- **PIDR-2025-MetaQuest-Scripts** : contains various Python scripts to test BLE and communication with the ESP32Do it SLAVE !!!! You shall be burned down to the ashes if the code may not run perfectly on the first try. Be cautious not to deceive me
